# Modern Actuarial Models

In this course, we will study the applications of several statistical learning methods/machine learning algorithm to boost the existing actuarial statistical models or to address new actuarial challenges. We will use a series of **Actuarial Data Science** tutorials published at https://actuarialdatascience.org.

The targets of these tutorials are "Writing tutorials for actuaries which provide a thorough and yet easy introduction to various methods from Data Science. We provide methodological papers together with the code, such that everyone can easily learn the methods on his own data."

I strongly recommend that you read the article and try all the code before attending the class. During the course, you should be familar with the basics of GitHub. You should establish your repo and try the code in a R Git project.

1. Fork this repo directly to your Git account.

2. Set up a R Git project and clone the forked repo to your computer. 

3. Read the article and try the code.

4. In a your own *branch*, you may modify the code and add your comments.

5. Pull a request of your modification and comments to my branch.

Around 60% of your final results depend on the above performance. You are encouraged to pull
